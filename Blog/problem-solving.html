                        <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Got blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
                            <p class="blog-1-para">Getting stuck on a problem can be a daily occurrence in all aspects of life, but it's the way that people go about solving that problem which is the difference between succeeding or failing. A little problem I came across just the other day was that I had to print off, fill in a form, then scan it back onto the computer for a studylink thing. Problem was, I don't have a printer. Instead of panicking and stressing about how to sort this application out, I googled if the library in Gisborne has a printing service. Once googling, I found a few different places that do print and scan services, but also found out that there are programmes on the web that you can use that actually digitally fill forms in, which canceled the whole need of a printer. After using google to research a solution, I completed what was needed of me and sent my form off. Throughout the process of trying to solve the problem, solution after solution was popping up which was awesome, but which one was really the best solution? Having to have a good think, I ended up going with the digital method. Overall, using problem solving skills such as researching the web really helped me not only sort the problem but opened my eyes to different ways of solving this one problem.</p>
                        <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Solved a problem in an elegant way:</h3>
                            <p class="blog-1-para"> When I was 17, in my last year of high school, I had a pretty big problem. I had to have major knee reconstruction, which would keep me from attending my school classes. This was a massive problem as I wanted to pass school with university entrance credits to give me a better shot at getting into uni but being out of class meant achieving that wasnâ€™t going to happen, unless I figured out a solution. One of the biggest problem solving techniques was using and reaching out to my teachers and peers within each subject. Being an all round easy going person, I was lucky to have built good relationships with my teachers as well as classmates, and before my surgery was booked in, I spent a couple weeks working alongside these people to build solutions and strategies around me being able to carry on learning and studying to get good grades whilst being at home, recovering from surgery. To put it in perspective, I couldn't go to school for 3 months, but throughout my recovery process, I managed to complete all the work given to me as well as finish it to a high standard through great communication with my teachers, with amazing friends physically dropping off class work and with the solutions we came up with like once a week catch ups where my design teacher would come to my house on friday for a cuppa and to look over/help me out with my work. I learnt that if you don't ask, then you won't receive. I asked for help from multiple teachers and at least 15 different students and being able to front them with my problem and work with them to come up with solutions was key to my success in getting my grades to uni entrance level.</p>
                         <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Reflect on how confident you feel <br> using the problem solving techniques and process</h3>
                            <p class="blog-1-para"> <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> Commenting or leaving messages for other developers when there are reading through your code. Pseudocode is like leaving a sticky note amongst your code for another developer to see, to remind yourself to do something or even breaking down what that specific code is. I am confident with this technique that it will evolve my coding skills and help me adapt to this new coding world.<br>

                            <strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> In software engineering, rubber duck debugging is a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck. At this stage of my coding abilities, I believe I would struggle doing this method as I don't have enough knowledge yet to explain things as clearly as a full stack developer, but later on I believe this will be a super helpful tool.<br>
                            
                            <strong>Error messages:</strong> Consciously look through and read the error messages the console is displaying. Read line for line and try understanding what the error is saying, where it is within your code. I feel okay with this for now, but I believe once I'm more clued up on coding, this solution will become a daily occurrence for me. <br>
                            
                            <strong>Console.log: </strong>Great way to check, modify, and resolve problems before going live. Testing beforehand is a great method to test if your code works, but if you need to fix some buggy code, the console.log will be your best friend. I feel pretty good using the console.log method, a super handy tool, especially whilst still learning the basics of Javascript <br>
                            
                            <strong>Googling: </strong>Fun fact, I googled the rubber ducky method! You see, modern day technologies such as search engines on the web enable us to have the power of information at our fingertips. Amazing tool to help identify problems and use similar or the same solutions, depending on your code. <br>
                            
                            <strong>Trial and error:</strong> You never know if you don't try right? The great thing about console.log is that it enables you to do exactly that. Trial your code to see if it works or not. If not then you keep changing and trying until you find something suitable. <br>
                            
                            <strong>Asking your peers for help: </strong>Being in a course such as this, having peers going through the same learning explorations can be super helpful as you can bounce ideas and different knowledge between one another. Being in the foundations channel on slack as well as going into class with the Tairawhiti crew has been a massive help in adjusting and learning new things. <br>
                            
                            <strong>Asking your teachers for help: </strong>Another great tool is asking questions to an educator that knows the answer, the benefit is not that you get the problem solved, but you actually learn and understand why the problem was solved with that solution as many tutors and teachers won't give you the answer, but yet will challenge you to think about it more and help you along with it <br>
                            
                            <strong> Progress through reflection: </strong>Reflection is key for understanding the resulting solution to the problem you had. It's a great tool to go over things you weren't quite sure about or even positive feedback if you think you nailed the problem on the head. Awesome to gain a better understanding and to help you mentally focus and understand the solution. I have been using this technique often and feel comfortable with doing this every day. <br>
