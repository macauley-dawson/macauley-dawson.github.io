                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading"><span class = "header-top">-Neuroplasticity-</span><br>Discuss how understanding the principles<br>of neuroplasticity benefits people:</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity can hugely benefit people of all ages to allow them the knowledge of how the brain can learn through experience, repetitive actions and thoughts, and how our neurons and networks can grow and develop if we put the principles into practice. Things such as reflecting on what you‚Äôve just learnt in that lesson or exploration, memorizing information and connecting the power of thinking with the action of doing can really help develop these new pathways to grow. It teaches young people that they aren‚Äôt limited to what they can learn and also gives them more encouragement and belief that they can learn what they want to. It helps develop the power of thinking and putting it into practice whilst learning. For example the ‚ÄúNot Yet‚Äù theory, explained by Professor Carol Dweck through one of her TED talks. Getting a ‚ÄúNot Yet‚Äù grade is much more influential to the student in the belief that they will eventually learn and understand rather than setting them at a level of ‚Äúfail‚Äù, which can harshly affect the motivation for the student to want to carry on learning that specific subject. Learning and practicing principles of Neuroplasticity can benefit everyone and help their belief within themselves that they can take on new and unknown challenges, as their brains are like sponges, able to take in new information and create new and powerful neuron pathways.</p>
                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Discuss how you might engage with the principles<br>of neuroplasticity for your own benefit:</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">I would engage with the principles of neuroplasticity like repetitive learning as going over and over the learning explorations and reflecting on my work I've completed would help me to retain that information. Putting thoughts into actions is also a great principle to practice and actively engage in as it helps build those pathways and evolve your way of thinking, especially as a developer. Being able to put an idea from your mind, into a plan on paper, then construct that plan through the knowledge you already have physically as code is an amazing skill to have and I believe that practicing this principle will mould me into a great, forward thinking developer.</p>
                     <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">In a learning aspect, reflection and repetitiveness will help the growth of neuroplasticity. Certain different activities can also help with strengthening your neuroplasticity, such as exercising endurance, making music, learning a different language and many other activities. These things have a similar aspect which is cognitive behaviour within the brain. Memorizing a phone number is hard work at first, right? But when you need to remember it, it's right there, isn‚Äôt it? So memorizing things trains your brain to build a strong pathway to easily access that knowledge when required. All these things will overall help develop stronger, more active neuron pathways within your brain.<br> 
                        Check the video out <a class = "link-change" href ="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve#t-40288" target="_blank">here!</a><br></p>  
                     <h3 class="blog-1-heading"><span class = "header-top">-Growth Mindset-</span><br>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>  
                        <p class="blog-1-para">Growth mindset is the mindset of being more positive in the way you learn and problem solve so you don't lose motivation and belief that you can do it. Having a growth mindset is changing the way you think to enable you to learn and grow in a positive and productive way. It's shaping your brain to think in a different way about challenges and problem solving, enabling you to be more encouraged about learning and not doubting yourself when things get hard. It's relevant to learning, as it can change the way you take in information and retain that information. Knowing that you will eventually learn it because it is possible mentally, is growth mindset and that will help power your positive attitude towards learning.</p>  
                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">In this exploration, did anything surprise you?</h3> 
                        <p class="blog-1-para">In this specific exploration, I found that I have previously had that thought of ‚ÄúFixed mindset‚Äù previously in my life. The thoughts like I wasn‚Äôt good or smart enough to do something so then I wouldn‚Äôt dedicate or push myself to learn it and get out of my comfort zone. The previous video with Professor Carol Dweck opened my mind up to the possibilities of positive thinking and having a growth mindset can really help you whilst learning. Engaging in the practices to help my mind rewire is an exciting thought, especially when I‚Äôm about to take on bootcamp.

                    <h3 class ="blog-1-heading">How will you integrate growth mindset<br>into your learning journey?</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">Being more positive and keeping the ‚Äúgrowth mindset‚Äù in the forefront of my mind will help encourage me to stick at it and to ask questions and not be shy of answering questions and giving it my best go. Taking on the idea of growth mindsets and practicing it whilst I am learning will, I believe, help me to keep giving everything my best shot with the thought of knowing I might not pick it up straight away.<br>
                        Check out this <a class = "link-change" href = "https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/" target="_blank">article</a> for more knowledge!</p>
                    <h3 class ="blog-1-heading">How will you blend this knowledge<br>with your learning plan and strategies?</h3>
                        <p class ="blog-1-para">Overall, keeping a positive mind set about ‚Äúgetting it‚Äù or ‚Äúnot understanding it‚Äù will allow me to keep on researching and learning until I do get it. It empowers me to want to get it and understand it even more so being in a positive mindset about learning. Keeping the growth mindset in my mind will ultimately allow constant progress, even if it's only tiny bits per day. Knowing that my brain can create new neural pathways for new information being learnt, I will have the confidence that I will be able to go forth and learn as much as I can whilst keeping positive about change and growth within my learning abilities.</p>
