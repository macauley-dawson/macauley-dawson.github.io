                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">Ideally, I'd love to end up within the gaming industry but I do know that is quite a niche market and it would take a lot of study and hard work but that is my long term goal. Whether it be working for big corporations using different software such as unreal engine or developing my own Games on Apps and PC. I know this isn’t a regular job so I have thought about other pathways such as becoming a web developer for an online sports forum blog. Either way, I'm wanting to create a career mixed with my passions as well as the tech side of web development</p>
                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">A description of your own strengths 
                        <br>and limitations in relation to learning:</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">One main strength I have when it comes to learning is that I'm not afraid to ask questions if I feel like I'm getting stuck whilst also being a fast learner. It saves me time and makes me understand what I was stuck on better if I have someone conversing with me about the problem. I take problems head first and try my hardest to find the solutions. A limitation whilst learning is feeling like I need to memorize every single thing that i’m learning so I am hoping throughout this course that I become more confident at learning more practically and making my learnings stick by practically doing it.</p>
                     <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like 
                         <br>to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">I would like to try and see my leadership skills grow. I've been in different jobs where I've had those kinds of responsibilities of a leading hand and I would like to work on those skills and see how they can benefit myself and my classmates as well whilst working through foundations and in bootcamp.</p>  
                     <h3 class="blog-1-heading">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme:</h3>  
                        <p class="blog-1-para">Having a timer app is very useful for me whilst learning at home. Setting simple break times allows me to come back focused and recharged to carry on with what I was learning. Keeping the conversations in class positive and not too social will help allow all of us to keep a steady pace of learning whilst also socialising and brainstorming project ideas in a productive manner. In using my human skills, I hope to be able to express my frustrations in a professional manner and ask classmates and facilitators for help. Talking about problems I have before they start stressing me out will be a key tool for my learning. </p>  
                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</h3> 
                        <p class="blog-1-para">I am very lucky to have my Partner as a full stack developer. She has been really helpful when it comes to answering questions I've had whilst learning from home. I am committed to not letting myself fall behind or slow down on my learning progress if I encounter a problem. I will actively find help to help me find a solution to that problem. </p>     
                <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What do I expect from the facilitation team?</h3> 
                    <p class="blog-1-para">Overall, just positive support. Having a facilitator who is knowledgeable but also kind and caring in regards to my learning journey. Positive but precise feedback whilst looking over my work will give me motivation to keep going and to get better. </p>
