                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS...</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">HTML is like the foundation and structure of a house and CSS is like the paint and fancy rounded couches that decorate the house; working together CSS can style your HTML.</p>
                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Explain control flow and loops:</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">Control flow is the order in which a programme executes/displays code. Code is run from top to bottom, or from the first line in the file to the last line in the file and carries on running like that, unless there is a change in the structure of code, for example if it encounters a loop. For example, I'll be using an everyday life activity such as filling up your car with petrol. Imagine the control flow being the process in which you would fill your car. You wouldn't pick up the pump if the petrol cap was still on right? Then imagine the loop being the amount of petrol you want and when you want the pump to stop. For example you could use the value of dollars or litres, and tell the loop to stop once youâ€™ve reached that certain value.</p>
                     <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Describe what the DOM is:</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">The Document Object Model, also known as the DOM, is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the webpage so that programmers can change the document structure, style, and content. There are many different aspects of the DOM, and that is why it is so handy to developers. You can look at what files/documents the current web page displayed has linked to it and what different types, such as HTML, CSS or JS files for example. Developers can give the webpage they are currently working on an audit on the web page which shows you how your webpage could function better, how it can be more accessible or to load quicker. The audit also shows you what youâ€™ve done well on your page too. The DOM allows developers to pull up specific information about a piece of code, fiddle around with it and delete bits if they want. An example of using the DOM for myself in the past couple weeks of this course at Enspiral Dev Academy was when I was first making this blog, I was using the DOM to add CSS style onto my HTML before actually making the changes stick in my code editor as it was an easy way for me to add, change and move different styles onto the HTML and seeing how it looks before pushing it up to go live.</p>  
                     <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects:</h3>  
                        <p class="blog-1-para">To be simple, whilst trying to access data from an Array, you use numbers as data in an array is numbered. For each item it has, they are given a numeric value as the index is numeric based and starts from zero. For Example, if you wanted your CD changer to play the 3rd CD, it would be CD2 as the index starts at zero. An object, on the other hand, is where you use words or letters to access data, which are known as strings. For example, show me the â€˜Bob Marleyâ€™ CD or â€˜Mixâ€™ CD. Rather than numbers to find the numbered item, you use keywords (strings).</p>  
                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Explain what functions are and why they are useful:</h3> 
                        <p class="blog-1-para">In Javascript, functions are groups of reusable code so that you don't have to write the same chunk of code out multiple times which saves you time and makes your code more efficient to read and reuse. They are also great for keeping your code nice and tidy, especially if you are using the same function over and over again such as a counter function, for example, on an online shopping site. Imagine the amount of code you would have to rewrite for every single product to have a counter list to allow the customers the option of getting more than just one of the same item?! Heaps, so functions are super handy in grouping code and making it reusable. </p>
