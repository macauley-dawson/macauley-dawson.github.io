                        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">Ultimately I'd like to pass this course to have an opportunity at a career in the tech industry, specifically game and software development, but having the core skills alongside those tech skills will also hopefully help me begin my own business journey as an entrepreneur and create a service for my local community to get out and about in the bush! </p>
                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What do you think your biggest strengths<br> and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">My biggest strength within bootcamp, I believe, will be my core skills in the ability to communicate with other people and try to help where I can. A limitation will be my strength of memory in trying to remember what we have worked on through foundations and bringing it all together. Eventually, I'll be able to code better after all the training and practice after bootcamp, but for now, my confidence in javascript is pretty low.</p>
                     <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What do you think your biggest non-technical<br> challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">Taking advice and critical criticism from other students most likely. I usually set a high standard for myself so I guess just dealing with that situation and reacting to the feedback positively will be a challenge but I am an easy going person so I believe I can overcome those challenges when they arise. Growth mindset!
                        </p>  
                     <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like<br> to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>  
                        <p class="blog-1-para">Leadership. If I can get my leadership skills to be developed, itâ€™ll help me in the future, especially if I'm wanting to run my own creative business team. 
                        </p>  
                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3> 
                        <p class="blog-1-para">As much clarity within the tech side of learning as possible. Testing our problem solving skills obviously, but having helpful tips and tricks to make the learning solidify in my brain.</p>     
                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3> 
                        <p class="blog-1-para">To be able to settle into the workload and begin to actually understand and learn more interactively rather than self learn. I expect myself to be as involved within projects as much as possible and be open and clear with my ideas and ability to communicate. I am committed to getting to class on time every morning and setting my day up for success with mindful rests and a good sleep the nights prior. I will be honest about my knowledge and will ask for help as soon as I feel stuck on something, especially within group projects! </p>
                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading"><span class = "header-top">-Foundations-</span><br>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">Ideally, I'd love to end up within the gaming industry but I do know that is quite a niche market and it would take a lot of study and hard work but that is my long term goal. Whether it be working for big corporations using different software such as unreal engine or developing my own Games on Apps and PC. I know this isnâ€™t a regular job so I have thought about other pathways such as becoming a web developer for an online sports forum blog. Either way, I'm wanting to create a career mixed with my passions as well as the tech side of web development</p>
                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">A description of your own strengths 
                        <br>and limitations in relation to learning:</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">One main strength I have when it comes to learning is that I'm not afraid to ask questions if I feel like I'm getting stuck whilst also being a fast learner. It saves me time and makes me understand what I was stuck on better if I have someone conversing with me about the problem. I take problems head first and try my hardest to find the solutions. A limitation whilst learning is feeling like I need to memorize every single thing that iâ€™m learning so I am hoping throughout this course that I become more confident at learning more practically and making my learnings stick by practically doing it.</p>
                     <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like 
                         <br>to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">I would like to try and see my leadership skills grow. I've been in different jobs where I've had those kinds of responsibilities of a leading hand and I would like to work on those skills and see how they can benefit myself and my classmates as well whilst working through foundations and in bootcamp.</p>  
                     <h3 class="blog-1-heading">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme:</h3>  
                        <p class="blog-1-para">Having a timer app is very useful for me whilst learning at home. Setting simple break times allows me to come back focused and recharged to carry on with what I was learning. Keeping the conversations in class positive and not too social will help allow all of us to keep a steady pace of learning whilst also socialising and brainstorming project ideas in a productive manner. In using my human skills, I hope to be able to express my frustrations in a professional manner and ask classmates and facilitators for help. Talking about problems I have before they start stressing me out will be a key tool for my learning. </p>  
                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</h3> 
                        <p class="blog-1-para">I am very lucky to have my Partner as a full stack developer. She has been really helpful when it comes to answering questions I've had whilst learning from home. I am committed to not letting myself fall behind or slow down on my learning progress if I encounter a problem. I will actively find help to help me find a solution to that problem. </p>     
                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What do I expect from the facilitation team?</h3> 
                         <p class="blog-1-para">Overall, just positive support. Having a facilitator who is knowledgeable but also kind and caring in regards to my learning journey. Positive but precise feedback whilst looking over my work will give me motivation to keep going and to get better. </p>
