                <h2 class="second-heading">My opinion...</h2>
                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What are three new things you have learned <br>about yourself and your ego as a result <br>of the core learning?</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">Three new things I have learned about myself and my ego over the past 5 weeks in foundations, learning about core skills would be that I can learn new skills with time and practice, to not be so harsh on myself during the tougher more frustrating times and that I can pass a challenge if I really put my mind and effort to it. I knew from the start of this course that it was going to be hard, but getting to the end of sprint 5, and on time, has made me realise that our brains are like sponges, and that you are never too old to learn new skills. No matter how hard the challenges and tasks are, you are fully capable of learning them. </p>
                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What are the role of values, empathy <br>and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">The role that my values played for me during this 5 week learning journey was really perseverance to guide me to the finish line. No matter how frustrated or confused I got, I stuck in there and thanks to the role of that value, I've made it to the last week. Self awareness and empathy also played a big part in my learning journey. Knowing when to have a break from things and being empathetic towards myself in not understanding things and really stepping back and having that self awareness to say to myself ‚Äúit‚Äôs allgood, you will get there, it will eventually all make sense‚Äù was really powerful in the aspect of keeping me going and co existing alongside my values to ultimately push myself to get here.</p>
                     <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">I noticed that a lot of it came naturally. I've had a pretty hard time with mental health so I've got a fair bit of self awareness but that can also be a defect as I can reflect and take things out on myself as well. What really surprised me was the aspect of the ‚Äúgrowth mindset‚Äù. I found I had been stuck in a fixed mindset about quite a lot of different things in my life and learning about growth mindset was really interesting and was eye opening.</p>  
                     <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>  
                        <p class="blog-1-para"> Learning about neuroplasticity was challenging but so rewarding as it opened my mind up in the aspect of being able to learn new skills at any age!
                        </p>  
                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Why do you think we, a programming school, <br>are spending so much time focusing on core learning <br>in a web development bootcamp course?</h3> 
                        <p class="blog-1-para">Simple; if you can code but can't communicate and work with teams and develop your social/human skills, no one will want to hire you, let alone want to be on a project working alongside you. Human skills play a big part in the world being able to function as it does and having great human core skills can set yourself up for success chasing jobs in your field of expertise.
                        </p>   
                    <h3 class ="blog-1-heading">Does the time you spent studying core learning <br> here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used<br> that time to practising programming instead? <br>Justify your answer.</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">Not at all! In fact I found the reflections to be a great place for me to actually look back at what I am learning and actually link some core work I've learnt with my actual learning abilities and it's cool to see. I think good core skills are definitely needed in an industry such as this. To be able to communicate, present ideas to a supervisor or boss, solve problems, work on projects along with someone and actually listen to what they have to say and understand their emotional behaviour about a subject or topic whilst bouncing ideas back to them afterwards, all these things are massive in being successful as a developer. I think it's a great addition to an otherwise very technical course without core skills. </p>
