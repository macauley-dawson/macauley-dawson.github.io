                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">Emotional Intelligence is a person's ability to perceive, control and evaluate emotions. Not only their own, but being able to understand, interpret and respond to other people's emotions too. It's a known fact that emotions can change your thoughts, for instance when your emotions are running high and you are stressed, it changes the way our brain functions and it can blur our cognitive abilities and behaviour, decision making and even our interpersonal skills can be affected. Being able to understand our own emotions and change our behaviour to positively affect others emotions can help us in our personal and professional lives. Recent studies have shown that having a high EQ can boost your chances massively in being successful within getting jobs, especially within the tech industry.</p>
                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">How is it different to IQ?</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">IQ, short for intelligence quotient, is a measure of a person‚Äôs reasoning ability. In short, it is supposed to gauge how well someone can use information and logic to answer questions or make predictions. IQ tests usually test memory and the ability to solve problems and how quickly. There are big differences between IQ and EQ, and one of them is self awareness of emotions. If you‚Äôre self aware of your emotions, you are able to use that awareness to guide you to making clear minded decisions. If you can recognize someone else's emotions throughout their body language, tone of voice, facial expressions ect, then that enables you to understand how they are really feeling about the topic being discussed and gives you a platform to then influence and work off of in regards to your reply and actions. Scientists have been arguing for years now about which one is better to be on the side of, but scientist Daniel Gole cites the Harvard Business School research that determined that EQ counts for twice as much as IQ and technical skills combined in determining who will be successful.</p>
                     <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Why is it important?</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">I believe it's majorly important in society today. Being able to understand your own  emotions, controlling them and evaluating them enables you to be clearer minded, especially when it comes to decision making. Having the ability to recognize when someone is struggling or in a bad mood enables you to create a conversation or response that won't trigger those emotions, but rather help find solutions to the problems causing the bad moods. Imagine trying to communicate to a colleague about how stressed out you are about an upcoming project deadline or budget and they reply with ‚ÄúSeen what's coming out in the movies?‚Äù, you‚Äôd be pretty angry and probably more stressed right? Having a solid understanding of EQ and practicing it daily will help you become more successful in all aspects of life and is important in building a great base foundation of emotion control.
