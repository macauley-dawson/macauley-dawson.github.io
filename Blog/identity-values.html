                        <p class="blog-1-para">Since a young age, my parents ingrained respect and politeness into me and to this day they are some of my biggest core values that I base my behaviour and actions on. Being bullied as a kid at school for my size took its toll on me but never did I once retaliate in anger cause my parents had taught me how to respect another person and their boundaries and differences. My dad taught me ‚Äútreat someone how you would like to be treated‚Äù and it's stuck ever since. Being bullied a lot also made me build another core value I still use to this day and that is patience. I was never a confrontational person so that helped me develop my patience, but not only with people, but with tasks and problems I had. Trout fishing at Lake Waikaremoana can test your patience though!! My mother is a firm believer that manners and politeness make the world go round. Be nice and show kindness instead of being negative and dull. A simple please or thank you can change the whole mindset and demina of a person and their reaction. Manners can get you far in life! Which brings me to another important value I hold and that is compassion. I am a compassionate person and I love helping people where I can, especially in a mental way, regardless if they are a close friend or a total stranger. Another core value that I base my learning and working on is my work ethic. Being positive about the work or course can really help you achieve some amazing feats and it makes working hard easy. Basing my learning on that value will really help me achieve this course.</p>
                     <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Strengths and limitations within learning:</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">A definite strength I have in regards to learning is that I will preserve. I will be patient and try to keep at it. My hard work ethic will allow me to get the work done, but patience and perseverance will allow me to learn well and take my time with things that I am stuck on. It will help massively when working in group projects as my work ethic and ability to persevere will allow me to evolve and grow my team work skills. A limitation with learning in a flipped class environment for me is that sometimes I will just try to figure the problem out without asking for help. I've been slowly teaching myself that it is ok to have questions and that no question is a silly question. I guess putting a bit of my ego from that hard work ethic away and accepting that I'm stuck and that I need help will ultimately allow me to grow into a more productive learner. </p>
                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Strengths that help overcome obstacles:</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">Perseverance and patience. If I can persevere with a problem, take a step back and remind myself that I won't know every single thing about coding, that will help me massively with overcoming obstacles. Keep pursuing the right answer or way, be patient with your own understanding and keep persevering if it does get super hard. Over time my confidence will grow and my perseverance will have paid off. </p>

                        <p class="para-quote">‚ÄúOne of Macs core values is reaching out and helping people going through hard times, particularly mantally. I've seen him do this on multiple different occasions with friends and workmates, having chats with them about his own personal struggles, relating to them and always being available for a phone call when people needed it. He has a large sense of empathy and likes to be able to help people where he can. A time where he really showed this was when a good friend of his, Codi, had cancer and he would take him out regularly for curly fries and milkshakes to take his mind off his situation and have good chats with him out of the house. Mac also values fairness and everyone getting a fair go regardless of how they look or where they are from. This goes all the way from his love of sports to his work. He has had the chance to work with quite a few different nationalities while in the mines and learned to never judge a book by its cover. A non social value of Mac is nature and we are both missing it whilst in lockdown. Nature is a happy place for Mac whether it be hunting, fishing or going out to his good mates farm and helping out up there. Mac knows this is a happy place and a good way to take a break from everyday stress.‚Äù</p>

                        <p class="para-quote">‚ÄúOne of your biggest core values is the respect you have for your elders Mac, especially grandparents. When we went to the UK in 2018 to see family you haven't seen in 14 years, I was so overwhelmed with the respect and patience you showed to your grandad who had dementia, he was very difficult to have a proper conversation with and was very easily agitated but you sat with him several times and treated him no differently to anybody else, helping him up, making sure he was okay and conversing with him about whatever he had going on in his mind, dealing with someone with dementia is difficult for anyone of any age and the fact that you hadn't seen him for so long you treated him like you saw him everyday, that meant the world to me and shows me what core values you have xx‚Äù</p>

                        <p class="para-quote">‚ÄúMacauley or Big Mac as we all knew him throughout high school. This is a name of a person in which everyone knew quite well, but no one ever had any problems or issues with. This really went to show how kind he was as a class mate and how he respected everyone and their differneces. He can personally connect with everyone around him and does a good job of it‚Äù</p>

                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Culture and values:</h3>
                         <p class="blog-1-para"> I was brought up in a household that good behaviour was taught to us at a very early age. Luke (my brother) and I were taught at a young age that being kind, polite and using manners was the only right way of behaving. My parents, one being kiwi, and one being english, did have differences in the thoughts of raising children but they set a culture of hard work ethic and being responsible for our actions. Our behaviour was sharply motivated by this culture of work hard and you'll earn it and to this day, both my brother and I believe in hard work will get you far. Throughout my life I've strived to better myself and if my parents hadn't set that hard working, kind but responsible nature and culture into me I wouldn't be where I am today.</p>
                    <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Ethical decision:</h3>
                        <p class="blog-1-para">When I was working in the fields, picking tassels out of maize plants, I found myself in a situation where I had to make an ethical decision. A decision that could make or break my weekly bonus but also make or break someone's motivation and drive to continue working. It was a friday afternoon, Ben and I had been teamed together that day and it was a hot 30 degree day. Ben, at the time, was 16. As the older person, I felt a responsibility to make sure he's allgood whilst working and to help him out when I could. Being a tall lad, I had an advantage when maize detasseling, which made me work a lot quicker than my pair, Ben. This created a problem which made me have to make an ethical decision. Based on my value of patience, I was confronted with a situation.  Do I keep working at my pace, leaving Ben behind for possibly 3-4 hours just so I could finish my rows and get my weekly bonus before the day finishes or do I stay working alongside Ben, keeping him motivated and making sure he doesn‚Äôt feel like he isn't good enough. I was desperate for that weekly bonus but I couldn't let myself leave Ben working by himself. I remembered in my younger days on a school trip, we went on a walk on a track and three of us were left behind because the other kinds were not patient enough to wait for us. We felt left out and ultimately I ended up wanting to go home. So I thought to myself ‚Äúhow would Ben feel if I just carried on working and left him behind?‚Äù I decided to cruise alongside Ben, having great conversations and telling life stories to him. By the end of the day, I hadn't made my weekly bonus, but what I had made was a decision that created a great friendship and overall kept Ben motivated to carry on doing the maize detasseling work (trust me, it is hard work). If I hadn't been patient and willing to sacrifice my weekly bonus, I would have never made that same connection and friendship I made with Ben. </p>
